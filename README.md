# TrueCaller_Blog
Created with CodeSandbox


Create a page that lists the 25 most recent posts, that also lets you load or navigate
to older entries. Each entry should display a thumbnail, title, excerpt and time since
post was published (such as 5minutes ago, 3 days ago etc.)
● When clicking on any entry in the list, load or navigate to a page / view that displays
the post’s title, thumbnail, date and full post content. This page / view should also
display and link to a maximum of 3 related posts (information about retrieving
related posts can be found in the REST api documentation).
● Add a sidebar to the page that:
○ Lists the available categories of the blog
○ Lists the top 10 tags (based on post counts)
When any category or tag is clicked, posts within the clicked tag or category should
be loaded and listed in the same way as the 25 most recent posts are displayed.
